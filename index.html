<section id="expected-value-after-1-flip" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="expected-value-after-1-flip">1) Expected Value After 1 Flip</h3>
<p>The expected value (EV) of the account balance after one flip is <strong>greater than</strong> the initial $30,000 investment. We can calculate this by taking the weighted average of the two possible outcomes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Heads (50% chance):</strong> Balance becomes $30,000 * 1.50 = $45,000.</li>
<li><strong>Tails (50% chance):</strong> Balance becomes $30,000 * 0.60 = $18,000.</li>
</ol>
<p>The expected value is <code>(0.5 * $45,000) + (0.5 * $18,000) = $31,500</code>.</p>
<p>This represents an expected gain of <strong>$1,500</strong>, or <strong>5%</strong> of the initial buy-in. The waterfall chart below visualizes how we arrive at this expected value. It starts with the initial balance and shows the weighted “pull” of the potential loss and the weighted “push” of the potential gain. Because the weighted gain is larger than the weighted loss, the final expected value is positive. Based on this simple, single-flip analysis, the positive expected return suggests that one <strong>should</strong> buy into the game.</p>

<p>This time series plot tracks the journey of the initial $30,000 investment over 50 years for one specific, randomly generated sequence of coin flips. The y-axis is on a logarithmic scale to better visualize the dramatic percentage changes in wealth.</p>
<p>In this particular run, the outcome is disastrous. After an initial period of growth, a string of bad luck sends the balance plummeting. The final balance is nearly zero, representing a near-total loss of the initial investment.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> This single, harrowing simulation provides a crucial reality check. While the expected value analysis in Section 1 was optimistic, this plot demonstrates the immense <strong>volatility and risk</strong> of the game. It shows that a positive average return doesn’t protect you from a terrible outcome. This single path highlights the danger of “path dependency”—where an unlucky streak can wipe you out, making recovery impossible. It serves as a powerful cautionary tale and motivates the need to analyze a much wider range of possible futures, which we will do in the next section.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simulations-distribution-of-final-balances">3) 100 Simulations: Distribution of Final Balances</h3>
<p>This section moves beyond a single to total run to show the full spectrum of possibilities. By simulating the game 100 times, we can analyze the distribution of final balances and understand the investment’s true risk profile.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Analysis:</strong> The histogram reveals a highly <strong>right-skewed distribution</strong>. This means that while most simulations result in modest outcomes (the cluster of bars on the left), a small number of simulations lead to extremely large wins (the long tail stretching to the right).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Median vs.&nbsp;Mean:</strong> The <strong>median</strong> (orange line), or typical outcome, is significantly lower than the <strong>mean</strong> (green line). This is a classic sign of a skewed distribution, where the average is pulled up by a few outlier jackpots. The median gives a more realistic expectation for any single run.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Loss:</strong> A noticeable portion of the distribution falls below the initial $30,000 investment (red line), highlighting the real risk of losing money over the long term.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Probability of a “Happy” Outcome:</strong> Assuming a “happy” outcome is any result where the final balance is greater than the initial $30,000 investment, the probability is <strong>68.0%</strong>. This means that in roughly two-thirds of the simulations, the investor ended with a profit. While these are favorable odds, the wide distribution shows that the magnitude of that profit is highly uncertain.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="probability-balance-30000-at-age-75-original-game">4) Probability Balance &gt; $30,000 at Age 75 (Original Game)</h3>
<p><strong>Report the probability estimate and interpret its practical meaning.</strong></p>
<p>The probability of ending with a final balance greater than the initial $30,000 after 75 years is a crucial metric for evaluating the game’s long-term viability. The visualization below illustrates this probability by highlighting the portion of the final balance distribution that exceeds the initial investment.</p>
<p>From our 100 simulations, we observe that a significant portion of the outcomes result in a balance greater than the initial $30,000. This suggests that, despite the volatility and the risk of near-total loss in some scenarios, the positive expected value per flip (as seen in Section 1) can lead to favorable long-term outcomes for a substantial number of paths.</p>
<p>The estimated probability is <strong>68.0%</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Meaning:</strong> This figure suggests that if 100 people played this game, we would expect about 68 of them to walk away with more money than they started with. For a single investor, it represents a roughly 2-in-3 chance of turning a profit over their 50-year investment lifetime. While not a guarantee, these are favorable odds that make a strong case for playing the game, assuming the investor can tolerate the risk of being in the unlucky 32%.</p>
<p><strong>How to Read the Plot:</strong> The plot below is a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), which directly visualizes these probabilities. The y-axis shows the cumulative probability. - The blue curve shows the running total of outcomes. To find the probability of losing, find the <strong>$30,000</strong> mark on the x-axis (the red line). The height of the curve at this point is <strong>32%</strong>. This means 32% of all simulations ended with a loss. - The <strong>red shaded area</strong> visualizes this 32% cumulative probability of loss. - Since the total probability is 100%, the remaining portion must be the probability of profit: <code>100% - 32% = 68%</code>. The <strong>green shaded area</strong> visualizes this remaining 68% of outcomes.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modified-strategy-bet-exactly-50-each-round">5) Modified Strategy (Bet Exactly 50% Each Round)</h3>
<p>This modified strategy introduces a crucial element of risk management. By only gambling a fraction of the balance, we protect a significant portion of our capital from downturns. The visualization below directly compares the distribution of final balances from this new strategy against the original, all-in strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Which is riskier?</strong> The modified strategy is significantly <strong>less risky</strong>. The worst-case outcomes are dramatically improved, with the minimum final balance being much higher than in the original game. The entire distribution is narrower and less spread out, indicating lower volatility and a smaller chance of catastrophic loss.</p>
<p><strong>Which has better upside?</strong> The original, all-in strategy has a <strong>better upside</strong>. Its right tail extends much further, meaning the potential for astronomical gains is higher. However, this comes at the cost of higher risk. The modified strategy, while safer, has a lower ceiling on its maximum potential return.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The modified strategy offers a more balanced approach. It achieves a near-certainty of turning a profit (a probability of 100% in our 100 simulations) and protects against devastating losses. In contrast, the original game is a high-risk, high-reward proposition. For most investors, the modified strategy would be preferable due to its superior risk-adjusted returns.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="briefly-explain-your-findings-from-the-previous-step-in-light-of-a-concept-known-as-the-kelly-criterion">6) Briefly Explain Your Findings From The Previous Step in Light of A Concept Known as the “Kelly Criterion”</h3>
<p>The dramatic difference in outcomes between the original and modified strategies can be explained by a powerful concept from information theory and finance known as the <strong>Kelly Criterion</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Kelly Criterion?</strong></p>
<p>The Kelly Criterion is a formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets to maximize the long-term growth rate of capital. It doesn’t focus on maximizing the profit of a single bet, but rather on maximizing the <em>logarithm</em> of wealth over many repeated bets. This approach inherently favors strategies that produce consistent growth while avoiding the risk of ruin (losing everything).</p>
<p>For a game with simple win/loss outcomes, the formula for the optimal fraction of your bankroll to bet (<code>f*</code>) is:</p>
<p><code>f* = (p / a) - (q / b)</code></p>
<p>Where: - <code>p</code> = Probability of winning (0.5 for Heads) - <code>q</code> = Probability of losing (0.5 for Tails) - <code>a</code> = The fraction of capital lost on a loss (40% or 0.40) - <code>b</code> = The fraction of capital gained on a win (50% or 0.50)</p>
<p><strong>How does it relate to our strategies?</strong></p>
<p>Plugging in the numbers for our game:</p>
<p><code>f* = (0.5 / 0.40) - (0.5 / 0.50) = 1.25 - 1.0 = 0.25</code></p>
<p>The Kelly Criterion calculates that the optimal bet size for this game is <strong>25%</strong> of the current balance.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Original Strategy (Bet 100%):</strong> This is a form of “over-betting.” By betting four times the optimal Kelly fraction, the strategy introduces massive volatility. While it creates the possibility of huge windfalls, it also dramatically increases the risk of catastrophic loss and, counter-intuitively, <em>reduces the long-term compound growth rate</em> compared to the optimal strategy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modified Strategy (Bet 25%):</strong> This strategy is, by definition, the <strong>Kelly-optimal strategy</strong>. It is mathematically calibrated to produce the highest possible median long-term outcome for this specific game. It perfectly balances the potential for gains against the risk of losses to maximize the compound annual growth rate.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The graph below illustrates this concept by plotting the expected long-term growth rate for different bet sizes. As you can see, the growth rate peaks precisely at a 25% bet size and falls off dramatically as you approach a 100% bet, demonstrating why the original strategy is so risky.</p>
